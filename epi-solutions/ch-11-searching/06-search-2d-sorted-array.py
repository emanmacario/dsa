# Call a 2D array sorted if its rows and its columns are nondecreasing. 
# For example:
#   -1  2  4  4  6
#    1  5  5  9 21
#    3  6  6  9 22
#    3  6  8 10 24
#    6  8  9 12 25
#    8 10 12 13 40

# Design an algorithm that takes a 2D sorted array and a number and checks 
# whether that number appears in the array. For example, if the input is the 
# 2D sorted array in the example and the number is 7, your algorithm should 
# return false; if the number is 8, your algorithm should return true.
