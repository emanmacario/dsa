# Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but
# the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to
# that node.
# EXAMPLE
# lnput:the node c from the linked lista->b->c->d->e->f
# Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e- >f
# Hints: #72
